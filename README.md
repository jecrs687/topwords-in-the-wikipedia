Some days ago, i was talking with my father about languages and he told me about a research on that area. 
I discoreved in that conversation a amazing information: 
 > *I could became fluency in others languages if i can learn the mosts three thousands comons worlds*.

And, because that information, i started this project. </br>
The first things I needed thought is:  *Where i can find a huge quantity of words in english?*

And i found it: 
- Wikipedia 
- subtitles

How does this code work? - you asked me
And I will answer for wikipedia:
1.  Doing web scraping it gets almost than 10k articles randomly in wikipedia
2.  After that, the code apply some filter to remove trash
3.  The code starts counter how many times each word reapeats. 
4.  One time got this, it starts to create a file .txt with the words sorteds
